# **Prediction of Product Sales**
- **Author:** Parris Trimingham

# Business problem:
Since our end goal is to increase sales, we can produce a few charts that will help us to see the properties of products, and trends, that play a crucial role for the company. There are many factors that can be used to promote the sales of an outlet item. Does weight or fat content play a role? We can analyze the past, to predict the future. Will history repeat itself?

# Data Dictionary:

For this dataset, there are 8523 rows, and 12 columns.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
- A boxplot and histogram are used to help visualize for each numeric datatype column. 
- And a barplot is uses to visialize for each categorical column.
- This gives a good baseline for all of the numeric and categorical columns for univariate EDA.

This histogram shows that the majority of the Outlet Sales are around the 12.5 item weight.

This barplot shows that Fruits and Vegetable has the most Outlet Sales.

The top five highest item sales are as follows:
- Fruits and Vegetables
- Snack Foods
- Household
- Frozen Foods
- Dairy

# Recommendations:
It is my professional recommendation that we factor weight into the sales. It appears that customers really do factor in the weights of items into their purchasing. While Fruits and Vegatables are cleary the best seller, even this is limited to the weight of the items.
